## 💬 Personal Note

I’m deeply passionate about applying data to improve processes, uncover insights and support decision-making. Coming from an engineering background, I value precision, structure, and logic — and I bring those values into every data project I work on. My goal is to work in a collaborative environment where I can keep growing as a data professional and contribute with impact.
